## Neural Network(Transformers)-based Port Logistics Prediction Model 

### 1. Project Introductions

Comming Soon...

#### Dataset
**National Logistics Information Center** provides publicly cargo and passenger transportation data for 27 major ports in Korea (www.nlic.go.kr). We applied that data to our preprocessing process and then used it to analyze time series data and train(or predict) neural network models. 

#### Overall Pipeline
To summarize the entire process of the **『Transformers-based Port Logistics Prediction Model』** we designed, it consists of the following three steps.
  - STEP 1) Port logistics volume data pre-processing
  - STEP 2) Time series data analysis and visualization
  - STEP 3) Port volume training and prediction using Transformer-based model
